# What is this?
A few days ago I was sitting on my balcony and experienced that my sun umbrella looks like a
stick (I didn't knew the correct word at that time) of a sun clock if packed into it's protective sheet.
So I wanted to investigate into the math behind sun clocks.
This project is the result.

I've written this in python as I've found out about the library pysolar which makes this whole thing much easier.
Some trigonometric calculations and a graphical export (I went for SVG on this one) is what was left to be programmed.

# Disclaimer

This project might be very incomplete and inaccurate. Don't trust this source code when trying to build a sun clock.
The intention of this project is of experimental nature.
I'm a C/C++ developer and so this project might not be entirely in the spirit of proper python development.
